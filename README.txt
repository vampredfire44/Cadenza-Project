CADENZA

CADENZA is a fun, motivational music theory game that encourages users to learn about cadences and chord progressions in an interactive way. 


The motivation behind this project was that I found the traditional rote memorization used in music theory books unexciting. So, I decided to create a game that would pique both kids’ and adults’ interest by providing them with challenges that teach them the cadences in any key and any time signature through visual and auditory methods. Being an avid lover of jazz, I also wanted a way that they could simply take a piece of music and turn it around by “Jazzify”-ing the piece and playing it back.
